/* Design a Java program to calculate Sin and Cos values
 from a right-angle triangle. Assume the values of a and b are
 4.5 and 9.5 respectively. Finally, print the Sin and Cos values
 of angle A and angle B (SinA, CosA, SinB, CosB). The
 formulas to calculate these values are given below.
 Hint: You need the values for all 3 sides to calculate both
 sin and cos. You are given only a and b. How would you get
 the value of c? Youâ€™ll need the help of Math.sqrt().
